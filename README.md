CALISTA provides a user-friendly toolbox for the analysis of single cell expression data. CALISTA accomplishes three major tasks: 

(1)	Identification of cell clusters in a cell population based on single-cell gene expression data; 

(2)	Reconstruction of lineage progression and produce transition genes;

(3)	Pseudotemporal ordering of cells along any given developmental paths in the lineage progression.


## System Requirements

CALISTA toolbox is originally written for MATLAB. The subroutines in CALISTA (version 1.0) have been successfully tested on MATLAB 2016b,  2017a and 2018a. 

CALISTA-R toolbox is also provided for R users. The subroutines in CALISTA (version 1.0) have been successfully tested on R version 3.4.2 and RStudio Version 1.1.383
